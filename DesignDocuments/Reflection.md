<h1>Weekly Reflection</h1>

<h2>Week 1</h2>
Initially I'd wanted to continue a project from PHP class in the previous semester,
where I'd be making a dungeon-crawling RPG game played in the browser. However, I'm
not sure what the time constraints this semester are going to be like; I found out right
before the semester began that I'd be starting a new job during the day which will likely
be more time-intensive than the one I currently have.

My second option was an application for coordinating writers' groups, since this is
something I could find a use for. The writing group I'm currently following uses Meetup,
which mostly just allows group leaders to post announcements and dates while other members
make comments in response social-media style. Expanding on this with functionality for
submitting work and tracking one's overall progress as a writer (word count, average words
per day or week, et cetera) would, I think, be a good feature. 

<h2>Week 2</h2>
Stress over the new job (which didn't even start until Monday!) kept me occupied during
most of my normal homework time.  I'm looking at some additional features beyond just "post
work, read work later," like a visual tracker for the user's writing progress with a graph.
Not much other actual progress this week.

<h2>Week 3</h2>
The new job ended up consuming all my time this week and I got nothing done.
