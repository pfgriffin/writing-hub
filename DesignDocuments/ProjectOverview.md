<h1>Pierce Griffin Individual Project</h1>

<h2>Problem statement</h2>

While there exist many blogs and similar sites online for aspiring writers to publish their work,
my experience with online writing <i>groups</i> has usually taken place in a forum structure or
an e-mail list.  My goal is to create a Writing Hub website that will allow users to form groups and
publish writing prompts, allowing group members to submit their responses to each prompt and then
compare one another's work.  Group members' progress (in terms of word count) will be presented in
a graphical report.

<h2>Technologies</h2>
<b>Authentication</b><br/>
JDBC Realm Authentication from Tomcat will be used to authenticate users. A site administrator will have the ability to
create/read/update/delete all data. Group leaders (defined as any member who creates a group) will be able to add or remove
users and posts from their groups, as well as post writing prompts.  All users will be able to request to join groups, submit
posts to groups, and create groups of their own, as well as view reports of their own writing progress.

<br/>
<b>Database</b> <br/>
MySQL will be the database used.

<br/>
<b>Dependency Management</b> <br/>
Maven

<br/>
<b>CSS/Formatting</b> <br/>
Bootstrap

<br/>
<b>Logging</b> <br/>
Log4j

<br/>
<b>Hosting</b> <br/>
Amazon Web Services

<br/>
<b>Additional research</b> <br/>
A graphing API for visual representation of data.

<br/>
<b>Testing</b><br>
JUnit

<br/>
<b>Dev Environment</b> <br/>
IntelliJ IDEA
